# STARGAME-INFANTRY — Map Structure & Faction System

## 🌍 Overview: Spherical Maps
Each battle map is a seamless spherical terrain — players walking in any direction for long enough will return to the original point.

- **360-degree combat**: No safe corners, all directions are vulnerable.
- **Environmental effects**: Dust storms, snow, fog, day-night cycles dynamically affect visibility, accuracy, and tactics.

---

## 🏴 Factions
There are **three major factions**:

1. **Empire Forces** — Highly structured, heavy weapons
2. **Federation Troopers** — Balanced tactics, adaptable
3. **Rebel Resistance** — Guerrilla warfare, sabotage experts

---

## 📍 Territorial Control Zones

Each map includes:
- **3 Headquarters zones** (1 per faction)
- **6–10 Neutral zones** (contestable)
- **AI-controlled bases** that provide dynamic reinforcements and resource drops

Control impacts:
- Spawn points
- Reinforcement speed
- Command bonus range

## 🔁 Infinite Loop Navigation
Maps simulate a small planet:
- Walking 15–20 minutes in a straight line = return to origin
- Encourages flanking, long-range patrols, and strategic maneuvers

---

## 🌦️ Environmental Effects on Combat
- **Dust/snow storms**: Disrupt line-of-sight and bullet trajectory
- **Rain/mud**: Reduces movement speed
- **Time of day**: Night reduces vision, boosts stealth units

> Players must adapt to terrain, time, and climate to succeed.
