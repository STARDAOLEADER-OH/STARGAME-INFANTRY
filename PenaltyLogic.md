# STARGAME-INFANTRY — Penalty & Discipline System

## 🚫 Desertion & Team Disobedience

Players who ignore squad orders or leave squad range:

- **Lose merit gains** (XP cut by 50–100%)
- **Get marked on map** (visible to squad only)
- **After 2–5 minutes**, subject to discipline

---

## 👮 Military Police System

If a deserter is within controlled territory:
- AI Military Police may intercept
- Player is **detained for 30–180 seconds**
- Multiple offenses = longer detainment

---

## ⚠️ Grace & Freedom Zones

| Zone Type      | Penalty Rule                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Own Territory  | MP can arrest deserters        |
| Enemy Territory| No MP, but highly dangerous    |
| Neutral Zone   | Free movement, but no merit    |

## 📡 Communication Breach

- Soldiers who ignore repeated orders are flagged
- Squad leader can mute or restrict communication
- Vote-based demotion possible for poor behavior

---

## 🧨 Tactical Insubordination

Sometimes disobedience = brilliance.

- Tactical heroism is **rewarded** if it brings clear victory
- Squad must vote “commend” or “condemn” afterward

> Freedom exists — but so do consequences.
